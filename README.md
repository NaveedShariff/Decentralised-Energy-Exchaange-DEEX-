# Decentralised-Energy-Exchaange(DEEX)
Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX) does provides you the best market place for investing and trading the Renewable Energy Tokens (RETs).

## What is DEEX ?
**DEEX** does stands for Decentralised Energy Exchanged which is the market place to buy the RECs. Here the [RECs(Renewable Energy Certificates)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rec.asp) does explains a lot about the purchasing of Renewable energy for promoting the sustainable future but there are lots of disadvantages in it.

_*The problems with the REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) :*_

_*User Experience:*_ Purchasing the RECs is much difficult and complex process. It cannot be done without the help of a broker and this may cause heavy charges and loss of new buys.

_Less Liquid:_ Because of the complexities of purchasing the RECs creates less liquid. which is the buys finds hard to sell the certificates in their desired time.

_No Profits:_ As it is not linked directly with the Industries, The buyers can't get any profits even if they sell it at any time and this makes less buyers or traders to participate because of the no-profit system.

## How DEEX revolutionize the RECs ?


_*The problems with the REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) :*_
User Experience: Purchasing the RECs is much difficult and complex process. It cannot be done without the help of a broker and this may cause heavy charges and loss of new buys.

Less Liquid: Because of the complexities of purchasing the RECs creates less liquid. which is the buys finds hard to sell the certificates in their desired time.

No Profits: As it is not linked directly with the Industries, The buyers can't get any profits even if they sell it at any time and this makes less buyers or traders to participate because of the no-profit system.

## What it does
Our Solution takes the REC to the next level. First we created a token on the Hedera Blockchain and we named as RET (Renewable Energy Token) and these tokens can be purchased in our Dapp Decentralised Energy Exchange(DEEX) which is built on the Hedera Blockchain. When we see the backend process for every RET purchases, it does contains the users first who purchases the tokens from the Dapp then the purchased amount will be invested in the top 10 best renewable companies in the world. So it will be directly connected to the tokens and when these companies gets the investments then they will produce more Renewable energies and this is make a good increase in the industry and this will create profits for the users/buyers . ![Basic Chart of purchasing](https://i.ibb.co/dcFyBgC/basic.png)

This system gives the profit and benefits for traders, Renewable energy companies and the better environment. It will satisfy all the content and obviously it is a win-win situation. We have built this technology with more security and efficiency. As the DEEX connects with the various different Renewable Energy Producing companies, the price of the RET will be also determined by the price movement of those companies. When the investments from the buyers/users are collected in the exchange of the RET, the renewable energy companies will get new investors and it will affect the stock price positively and creates the benefit for the more production and that will positively affect the buyer's profits too.

## How we built it
The Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX) and the RET (Renewable Energy Tokens) are built and deployed on the Hedera Network. We used solidity as a base language and we chose HTS(Hedera Token Service) as the token standard rather then using the HRC-20, because HTS is a more advanced token standard that provides more flexibility in terms of token design and features. It includes features such as atomic swaps, token burning, and more.

We use React framework for the UI and this gives more user-friendly looks and the Decentralised Energy Exchange is created in the same bases with the help of solidity and with an option of exchanging the RET with other known tokens and the code link is given below.

Then to track renewable energy usage using Energy Web Zero, we have created a smart contract that records the energy produced and consumed, and allows users to view this information on the Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX).

We diversify the investments by investing them in the top renewable energy companies. The basic formulation is easy :

![DEEX](https://i.ibb.co/8664kQM/Group-19-2.png)

Investment per Asset = Total Investment Amount / Number of companies

For example, let's say you have $10,000 that you want to invest in 10 different companies. Using the formula above, you can calculate that the investment per asset would be:

Investment per Asset = $10,000 / 10 = $1,000

This means that you would invest $1,000 in each of the 10 assets, creating a diversified investment portfolio. By investing equally in multiple companies, you can help to reduce the risk of losing all of your investment if one asset performs poorly.

## Challenges we ran into
We faced lots of challenges and it was not very easy to give up so we solved our problems and brought everything closer to our accomplishment. The main problem here was making a link between the RET and the top renewable energy companies, we had no idea in it. But finally we found a way for aggregating the investments into the companies through the US stock market and it will be the secure and most liquid option quick buy and sell. Then we faced few basic problems but we have also found solution for those but creating a marketplace for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in Hedera blockchain is complex and we will face challenges like :

*Regulatory Compliance:* Renewable energy markets are highly regulated and it's important to ensure that the marketplace is compliant with local and national regulations. This can involve complying with standards such as the Renewable Energy Directive, Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Standards, and other related standards.

*Data Privacy* and Security: Since renewable energy certificates are issued based on energy production and consumption data, it's crucial to ensure that the data is securely collected, processed, and stored. The marketplace must also ensure that the personal data of users is protected and is not at risk of being accessed or hacked.

**Interoperability: **To ensure that the marketplace can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including energy producers, consumers, and regulators, it is important to ensure that the marketplace is compatible with existing systems and platforms. This includes developing APIs and protocols that enable data exchange and integration with other systems.

**Tokenization: **Tokenization is the process of representing a physical or digital asset as a blockchain-based digital token. Tokenizing RECs can provide benefits such as transparency, liquidity, and fractional ownership. However, tokenizing RECs can be challenging due to issues such as the lack of standardization and regulatory barriers.

*Adoption:* The success of a marketplace for RECs depends on its ability to attract and engage stakeholders. This requires developing user-friendly interfaces, marketing efforts to reach a wider audience, and partnerships with key players in the renewable energy sector. but finally we get a satisfaction for the completion of the project

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We experienced several hurdles, and it was difficult to give up, so we addressed our problems and moved everything closer to completion. The key issue here was establishing a relationship between the RET and the leading renewable energy providers, which we had no experience with. However, finally, we discovered a method for collecting investments into firms via the US stock market, and it will be the most safe and liquid choice for rapid purchase and sale.

## What we learned
In our journey we have learnt many skills and we made plenty of mistakes and we were struck in between many regions but we worked hard for finding the solutions and we learnt to use the tools for tracking the renewable energy which was fascinating and for sure we will implement these services like co2.storage, Hedera and energy web zero for many projects. We also learnt of clustering the frame work with the data sets and visualizing it was the best and fun part in our whole project time.

## What's next for Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX)
Our main motto is to make the RET (Renewable Energy Token) easily available to everyone, where everyone needs to contribute for the environment. So we have decided to list our token in various exchanges and provide this token for companies and businesses for using this as a smart contract, for transactions, for transferring and every single transaction like this will surely help the companies to produce more Renewable Energy.
