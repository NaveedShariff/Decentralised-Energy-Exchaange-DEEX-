# Decentralised-Energy-Exchaange(DEEX)
Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX) does provides you the best market place for investing and trading the Renewable Energy Tokens (RETs).

## What is DEEX ?
**DEEX** does stands for Decentralised Energy Exchanged which is the market place to buy the RECs. Here the [RECs(Renewable Energy Certificates)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rec.asp) does explains a lot about the purchasing of Renewable energy for promoting the sustainable future but there are lots of disadvantages in it.

_**The problems with the REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) :**_

_**User Experience:**_ Purchasing the RECs is much difficult and complex process. It cannot be done without the help of a broker and this may cause heavy charges and loss of new buys.

_**Less Liquid:**_ Because of the complexities of purchasing the RECs creates less liquid. which is the buys finds hard to sell the certificates in their desired time.

_**No Profits:**_ As it is not linked directly with the Industries, The buyers can't get any profits even if they sell it at any time and this makes less buyers or traders to participate because of the no-profit system.

## How DEEX revolutionize the RECs ?

Our solution takes the REC to the next level. Initially, we established a token on the [Hedera Blockchain](https://hedera.com) called RET(Renewable Energy Token), and these tokens may be acquired in our Dapp Decentralised Energy Exchange(DEEX), which is based on the [Hedera Blockchain](https://hedera.com). When we look at the backend process for each RET transaction, we can see that the consumers first purchase the tokens from the Dapp, and then the acquired amount is invested in the top ten best renewable enterprises in the world. So it will be directly connected to the tokens and when these companies gets the investments then they will produce more Renewable energies and this makes a good increase in the industry

This approach provides profit and benefits to traders, renewable energy companies, and the environment. That will fulfil all of the content, and it is clearly a win-win scenario. We designed this technology to be more secure and efficient. The price of the RET will be set by the price movement of the various [Renewable Energy Producing firms](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/top-alternative-energy-companies/) as the DEEX links with them. As the investments from buyers/users are gathered on the RET exchange, the renewable energy firms will gain new investors, which will positively effect the stock price and generate the advantage for greater production, which will also positively affect the buyer's profits.

## Working of DEEX
The Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX) and the RET (Renewable Energy Tokens) are built and deployed on the Hedera Network. We used solidity as a base language and we chose HTS(Hedera Token Service) as the token standard rather then using the HRC-20, because HTS is a more advanced token standard that provides more flexibility in terms of token design and features. It includes features such as atomic swaps, token burning, and more.

We use React framework for the UI and this gives more user-friendly looks and the Decentralised Energy Exchange is created in the same bases with the help of solidity and with an option of exchanging the RET with other known tokens and the code link is given below.

Then to track renewable energy usage using Energy Web Zero, we have created a smart contract that records the energy produced and consumed, and allows users to view this information on the Decentralised Energy Exchange (DEEX).

We diversify the investments by investing them in the top renewable energy companies. The basic formulation is easy :

Investment per Asset = Total Investment Amount / Number of companies

For example, let's say you have $10,000 that you want to invest in 10 different companies. Using the formula above, you can calculate that the investment per asset would be:

Investment per Asset = $10,000 / 10 = $1,000

This means that you would invest $1,000 in each of the 10 assets, creating a diversified investment portfolio. By investing equally in multiple companies, you can help to reduce the risk of losing all of your investment if one asset performs poorly.

## Why DEEX is unique ?
We encountered a number of roadblocks, and it was impossible to give up, so we handled our issues and got everything closer to completion. The main challenge here was building a partnership between the RET and the largest renewable energy providers, with which we had no prior experience. Nevertheless, we finally identified a technique for gathering investments into enterprises through the US stock market, and it will be the most secure and liquid option for quick buy and sale. Then we encountered a few simple issues, which we solved, but developing a marketplace for Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) in Hedera blockchain is hard, and we will face hurdles such as:

**Regulatory Compliance:** Renewable energy markets are highly regulated and it's important to ensure that the marketplace is compliant with local and national regulations. This can involve complying with standards such as the Renewable Energy Directive, Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Standards, and other related standards.

**Data Privacy** and Security: Since renewable energy certificates are issued based on energy production and consumption data, it's crucial to ensure that the data is securely collected, processed, and stored. The marketplace must also ensure that the personal data of users is protected and is not at risk of being accessed or hacked.

**Interoperability:** To ensure that the marketplace can be used by a wide range of stakeholders, including energy producers, consumers, and regulators, it is important to ensure that the marketplace is compatible with existing systems and platforms. This includes developing APIs and protocols that enable data exchange and integration with other systems.

**Tokenization:** Tokenization is the process of representing a physical or digital asset as a blockchain-based digital token. Tokenizing RECs can provide benefits such as transparency, liquidity, and fractional ownership. However, tokenizing RECs can be challenging due to issues such as the lack of standardization and regulatory barriers.

**Adoption:** The success of a marketplace for RECs depends on its ability to attract and engage stakeholders. This requires developing user-friendly interfaces, marketing efforts to reach a wider audience, and partnerships with key players in the renewable energy sector. but finally we get a satisfaction for the completion of the project

## Our Future 
We learned many skills and made many mistakes along the way, but we worked hard to find answers and we learned to utilise tools for tracking renewable energy, which was exciting, and we will definitely adopt services like [co2.storage](https://co2.storage/), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/), and [Energy web zero](https://www.energyweb.org/) for many projects. We also learned about clustering the framework with data sets and displaying it, which was the most enjoyable and enjoyable portion of our entire project period. Our major goal is to make the RET (Renewable Energy Token) freely accessible to everyone, as everyone has a responsibility to protect the environment. So we've chosen to sell our token on several exchanges and supply it to firms and enterprises for use as a smart contract, for transactions, for transferring, and every single transaction like this will undoubtedly assist the companies create more Renewable Energy.
